# What is project about?
This is an automated URL conversion program.
It is designed to simplify the visual and cognitive perception of Internet addresses, which can have cumbersome, and sometimes do not fit into messages and documents format.
This project provides the ability to perform the following functions:
  - create a temporary short link to an Internet resource;
  - get a short link by the user;
  - delete the short link (if the user is logged in);
  - provide the ability to select an alias for a short link;
  - to ensure the extension of the validity period of the short link;
  - provide a preliminary overview of the site content available via a short link;
  - provide three-month billing based on the number of short links available for creation for one user;
  - provide notification to the user about the expiration of the short link;
  - provide the generated QR code for the created short link.
